This IntelliJ plugin is designed to improve the improve the development experience when working with
both Apache Blueprint and Apache Camel.

Note, there is *currently* no support for Spring-DM (as it is deprecated). However, the Camel XML DSL
will be re-usable, so it is definitely a possibility in the future. We will happy welcome any contributions in this area though! :)
